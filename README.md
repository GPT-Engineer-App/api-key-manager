# api-key-manager

Can you create a user profile page for a company that distributes API-keys from several different API-providers?
Each user can subscribe to several keys
It should be easy to see: 
Which API the key is for
How much the API subscription costs
How long the key is valid
How many of the included calls the user has spent

The page should also include these fields:
Profile picture
Name of the user
Company of the user
Email of the user

These last fields should be open for editing. 

The page should also have a button for viewing and resetting the password.

I want you to use vibrant colours with weight on green and pink.
